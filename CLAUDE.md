# Physics Atlas (sophie_scicom) — Development Plan

> Single source of truth for the agent workflow. The agents read this file on
> every run as project context. Keep it lean.

## Project Vision

An accessible database of physics learning content, organised as a
**prerequisite DAG** (directed acyclic graph — not a tree: calculus,
mechanics etc. feed many paths). A learning goal (e.g. Cosmology) sits at the
top and connects through its prerequisites down to the fundamentals. Each
topic carries content (books, YouTube lectures, courses). Sophie maintains
the content; learners pick a goal — ambitious (Cosmology) or modest
(Special Relativity) — and get a generated curriculum.

**Type:** Static SPA — no backend (v1)
**Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, Cytoscape.js + dagre for the graph
**Audience:** Self-learners; the content author is Sophie (non-dev)

Design decisions + deliberately open alternatives:
`docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` (don't delete — every option stays as a path).

## Language

Everything in this repo is written in **English** — code, comments, docs, plans, reviews,
backlog/roadmap entries and commit messages.

## Stack Commands

| Command | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `npm install` | Dependencies |
| Build | `npm run build` | **Hard gate** — tsc + vite build, must run clean |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc -b` | Typecheck gate |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | oxlint |
| Validate | `npm run validate` | Data gate: topics.json (ids, refs, cycles) — there are no unit tests (yet) |
| Smoke | `CHROME_BIN=/usr/bin/google-chrome npm run smoke` | Browser smoke via puppeteer; needs a running dev server |
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Vite |
| Dev URL | `http://localhost:5173` | Chrome DevTools navigation target; `?mode=explore` for the explorer view |
| DB migrate | *(empty — no backend)* | |

## Key Patterns / Modules

- **`src/data/topics.json`** — the only data source. Schema rules in
  `docs/AUTHORING.md`. Run `npm run validate` after every data change.
- **`src/graph/dag.ts`** — `ancestorsOf()` (transitive prerequisites),
  `curriculumFor()` (topologically sorted curriculum),
  `expandedCurriculumFor()` (unit granularity: unit refs are `topicId` or
  `topicId/subId`, subtopic resolution rules mirrored in the validator).
  Graph logic belongs here, not in components.
- **`src/graph/levelColors.ts`** — validated level palette (foundation
  `#1baf7a`, core `#2a78d6`, advanced `#4a3aa7`, goal `#eb6834`). No
  magic hex values in components; app-chrome tokens in `App.css :root`.
- **`GraphView.tsx`** — the only place that touches Cytoscape. Selection/
  highlight via classes (`chosen`, `dimmed`, `onpath`) without re-layout.
- **Layout convention:** dagre `rankDir: 'BT'` — goals at the top, fundamentals
  at the bottom. Edges point from prerequisite → dependent topic.

## Subsystems (scope selection for the live-qa agent)

- `GraphRendering` (Cytoscape, layout, highlighting)
- `CurriculumLogic` (dag.ts, ordering, ancestors)
- `DataSchema` (topics.json, validator)
- `Routing` (mode switch, URL param)
- `DesignSystem` (tokens, palette, legend)
- `Accessibility`
- `Performance`

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict, 2-space indent, no new dependencies without a plan.
- No comments by default; only non-obvious WHYs.
- Edit > Write: modify existing files.
- a11y-first: semantic HTML, visible labels (node colours never carry meaning
  alone — legend + ink labels are mandatory).
- Content changes (topics.json) need `npm run validate` as a gate.
- Don't generate design assets — the user supplies assets.

## Agent System

Five agents + a playbook in `.claude/agents/` — details in `orchestrator.md`.

| Agent | When |
|---|---|
| `planner` | only shape-critical features (graph/layout, schema, new view mode, content deletion) |
| `developer` | every feature |
| `reviewer` | every feature — runs the gates, checks against the conventions above |
| `committer` | after a green review, and at wave close |
| `live-qa` | only at wave close (browser) |

**Wave** = whatever has been committed since the last `live-qa:` commit; it closes after
3 features, when `## Open` is empty, or on request. No lock file, no counter — git is the
source of truth.

Artifacts: plans in `.claude/plans/`, reviews and wave reports in `.claude/reviews/`.
Start: `./start-dev-session.sh`.

Deliberately **no** GitHub issue workflow, even though the repo now has its own remote
(`github.com/subutayebru/physics-atlas`): backlog and roadmap live in the repo and are
committed with every feature — a parallel issue tracker would be, for solo development, a
second place for the same truth. No agent pushes; you do that by hand.

## Deliberately not now

- No backend, no accounts, no CMS — data upkeep via topics.json + git.
- No native mobile app.
- No D3/React Flow rewrite (deliberate paths, see DESIGN-DECISIONS.md).
- Agents don't invent new physics *content* — Sophie curates content.

## Next bigger topics (roadmap hooks)

- Progress tracking (localStorage checkmarks per topic, % in the curriculum)
- Default-mode decision (goal-first vs. explorer) after user comparison
- Deployment (own repo + GitHub Pages)
- Search + filter by content type
