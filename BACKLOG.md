## Brainstorm Focus

Focus on learning UX around the prerequisite graph (curriculum, progress,
orientation in the graph) and a11y polish. Don't invent new physics content
— Sophie curates content via topics.json.

## Open

- [x] feature-1: Progress tracking — topics in the curriculum can be ticked off (localStorage), progress % per learning goal in the sidebar header, completed nodes subtly marked in the graph (check badge, not just colour).
- [x] feature-2: Topic search — search box in the header; a hit selects the topic in the active view and centres the graph on it. (In goal mode, a topic outside the current subgraph becomes the new learning goal.)
- [x] feature-3: Content-type filter — filter by book/video/course in the sidebar/detail; filter row above the resource list.
- [ ] feature-4: Fuzzy search — search tolerates typos ("cosmolgy") and also matches topic descriptions, not just titles. Small in-house implementation (e.g. bigram score), no new dependency without a plan.
- [x] feature-5: Curriculum export/print view — printable syllabus view of the current learning goal (ordered topics + resources + notes), via a CSS print stylesheet or its own route; button in the goal sidebar.
- [ ] feature-6: Progress on home goal chips — each featured goal chip on the home page shows its progress (ring or % badge) from localStorage.
- [ ] feature-7: Map zoom controls — floating +/−/fit buttons on the full map (glass style like map-card), for users without a scroll/pinch habit.
- [ ] feature-19: Bug — goal pick doesn't highlight in the full map — picking a goal on `?mode=map` applies neither the gold `goal-node` class nor `dimmed`/`onpath` on the topic graph (confirmed pre-existing on both `main` and the feature-16 branch, not introduced by the concept-map work). Likely cause per feature-16's developer: the highlight-applying effect in `GraphView.tsx` doesn't list `expandedIds` in its dependency array, so the auto-expand-triggered rebuild drops the highlight classes. Needs a developer pass + regression check against feature-13's original goal-highlighting verification.
- [ ] feature-20: Bug — two `npm run smoke` assertions fail against current `topics.json` — "optional toggle did not reduce the curriculum" (quantum-mechanics shows 0 optional badges) and "expected 13 diff-geo learning goals, got 14". Confirmed structurally pre-existing (unrelated to the feature-15/16/17 diffs — neither touches topics.json, GoalView, TopicPage, or dag.ts's logic). Needs investigation: is the smoke assertion stale against a data change from an earlier feature (e.g. feature-14's topic cleanup), or a real regression in the optional-prerequisite/subgoal-counting logic?
- [x] feature-13: Category colours + goal highlighting in the explorer — node colour switches from `level` (foundation/core/advanced/goal, purely decorative) to `category`: field=green, method=red, math-concept=blue (reclassify all 40 topics, Sophie reviews the mapping). In the explorer map (mode=map) a subtopic learning goal (promotable subgoal) can be picked directly as the target: the target is marked gold (dynamic state, not a category colour), relevant prerequisite units (`buildUnitGraph`/`expandedCurriculumFor`, unit granularity) are connected/highlighted, everything else dims (reuse the existing `highlightIds`/`dimmed` pattern from GoalView); target topics auto-expand to their relevant subtopics (reuse the existing `expandedIds`/⊕ toggle, but mark only relevant subtopics). A CTA leads into the existing curriculum page (GoalView, unchanged). Pilot content: new topic `relativistic-hydro` (subtopics `basics`, `viscous`, learning goal `israel-stuart`) as a placeholder skeleton wired under fluid-dynamics/special-relativity/differential-geometry — Sophie replaces the placeholder texts with real content.

- [x] feature-14: Topic cleanup + subtopics visible by default + hover zoom in the explorer — 6 uncategorised topics (lagrangian-mechanics, optics, standard-model, quantum-gravity-frontiers, stellar-astrophysics, galaxies-large-scale-structure) are removed completely from topics.json (not just hidden), including cleanup of affected prerequisites/optionalPrerequisites (general-relativity, quantum-field-theory, quantum-mechanics, black-holes-gravitational-waves, cosmology — 4 curricula get one step shorter as a result, deliberately accepted). Annotated topics (7 of 35) now show their subtopics open by default on the full map instead of collapsed (the ⊕/⊖ toggle stays for manual expand/collapse). New: hovering a topic with subtopics (only before a goal is picked) smoothly zooms/pans the viewport to topic+subtopics (the rest of the map stays visible), a pure viewport operation (`cy.animate({fit})`), no re-layout, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [x] feature-15: Concept graph schema foundation — migrate Sophie's seed (`data/seed/graph-data.json`, 54 nodes / 59 edges) into `src/data/concepts.json` (authored fields only, snake_case ids kept), shared `src/data/conceptVocabulary.json` (12 node types + the 17 edge sentence templates from the migration brief), new `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge` types in `src/data/types.ts`, `src/graph/concepts.ts` (sentence resolution, adjacency), new `scripts/validate-concepts.mjs` chained into `npm run validate`, and an AUTHORING.md section. Coexists with `topics.json`; nothing renders yet. The brief's data-quality issues are flagged (a `review` field on e7/e35/e39/e40/e57 + validator warnings for casing, orphans, example.com links), never resolved. Plan: `.claude/plans/feature-15-concept-schema-foundation.md`.
- [x] feature-16: Concept map view — new `?mode=concepts` ("Concepts (pilot)" tab), rendered by `GraphView` as a second input variant: colour by node type (validated 12-colour palette), circle size by `generality` (degree fallback, learning goals always smallest), relation sentences on edge hover and in the detail card, 1-hop highlight, zoom-linked fade, keyboard-accessible "Browse by type" index. Topic views unchanged. Needs feature-15. Plan: `.claude/plans/feature-16-concept-map-rendering.md`.
- [x] feature-17: Concept learning flow — pick any concept (esp. learning goals) as a goal in the concept map: ordered path over `strict prerequisite for` edges (reusing `dfsClosure`/`kahnOrder` from dag.ts), resources attached via `helps understand`, gold goal marker, progress checkboxes (`concept:` keys), `?mode=concepts&goal=<id>`, concept-aware header search. Needs feature-16. Plan: `.claude/plans/feature-17-concept-learning-flow.md`.

## Client feedback (2026-07-20) — deferred

- [ ] feature-8: Interactive simulations — new content type `simulation` + optional `codeUrl` field ("what the code does"); pilot: link the Franck–Hertz applet on Quantum Mechanics. Later: in-page embedding. Ref: https://mintapps.org/html/mint-franckhertz.html
- [ ] feature-9: Exercises with hidden solutions — `exercises` per subtopic (task, solution behind a toggle, own learning goal); pairing convention: solution of Ex. 1 seen → Ex. 2 tests the same thing. Client pattern "proofs hidden by default". Sophie curates the exercise content. Structure ref: https://sites.ualberta.ca/~vbouchar/MAPH464/section-multiplication-table.html
- [ ] feature-10: Formula/theorem popups — show referenced equations/theorems as a popover without leaving the page (same structure ref as feature-9).
- [ ] feature-11: Learning-approach labels + filter — tag content items (intuition-first / formal / hands-on …), filter chips like the type filter in ContentList.
- [ ] feature-12: Material rating 0–5 stars — v1 device-local (localStorage, "this helped me"); cross-user aggregation needs a backend (first real backend driver).

## Blocked

<!-- The orchestrator puts features here when the developer reported a product/content question.
     Format: `- [ ] feature-N: {title} — QUESTION: {what needs to be decided}`.
     Once the user answers the question, the entry moves back to `## Open`. -->

- [ ] feature-18: Retire the `Topic`/`Subtopic` model + category colours — move the remaining views (GoalView, TopicPage, TopicPrintSheet, Home chips, full map) onto the concept graph and delete `topics.json`/`categoryColors.ts`. QUESTION: how do the 35 course-level topics (with their curated books/videos, 8 featured goals and the compiled parallel-transport goal) relate to the concept graph? Should they be re-authored as typed concept nodes, kept permanently as course-level areas linked through the concept `domain` attribute, or dropped (which deletes every current curriculum, e.g. Cosmology)? Also: how should the duplicates be merged (`lg_pt_*` vs `content/goals/parallel-transport.md`, the relativistic-hydro nodes vs topic `relativistic-hydro`)? Content decision for Sophie; needs a planner run once it's answered.

## Wave-Log

### Wave 1 — 2026-09-27
Features: feature-15 (Concept graph schema foundation), feature-16 (Concept map view), feature-17 (Concept learning flow)
Live-QA: PASS
Open: one non-blocking advisory from feature-17's review (GraphView.tsx .goal-node opacity fix, visually confirmed working at live-QA) — no action needed. feature-19 and feature-20 (pre-existing bugs surfaced during this wave, confirmed unrelated) are logged separately under ## Open for a future wave.

## Done

<!-- Historical archive. The committer ticks features off in `## Open` and leaves them there — it doesn't move them into this section. -->
